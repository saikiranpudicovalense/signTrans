### Importing Necessary Modules
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import webbrowser
```
1. **`requests`**: This module is used to send HTTP requests to websites and get the responses. We use it to fetch web pages.
2. **`BeautifulSoup`**: This comes from the `bs4` module, and it's used for parsing HTML and XML documents. In this case, it's used to scrape the HTML content of the webpage.
3. **`webbrowser`**: This is a built-in Python module that allows you to open web pages in a web browser.

### Base URL of the ASL Website
```python
asl_website = "https://www.signasl.org/sign/"
```
- **`asl_website`**: This variable stores the base URL of the ASL website. The full URL to the sign language video is constructed by appending the specific phrase to this base URL (e.g., `https://www.signasl.org/sign/hello`).

### Function to Search and Extract the ASL Video URL
```python
def search_asl_phrase(phrase):
```
- **`search_asl_phrase`**: This is a function that takes a **`phrase`** (like "hello" or "how are you") and searches for it on the ASL website. It attempts to find the corresponding ASL video and then display it.

#### Formatting the Phrase
```python
    formatted_phrase = phrase.replace(" ", "-")
    phrase_url = f"{asl_website}{formatted_phrase}"
    print(f"Checking URL: {phrase_url}")
```
- **`formatted_phrase`**: This line replaces any spaces in the input phrase with hyphens. This is because the website uses hyphens to separate words in multi-word phrases (e.g., "how are you" becomes "how-are-you").
- **`phrase_url`**: The full URL is constructed by concatenating the base URL (`asl_website`) with the formatted phrase (e.g., `https://www.signasl.org/sign/how-are-you`).
- **`print(f"Checking URL: {phrase_url}")`**: This outputs the URL that will be checked for the phrase to the console.

#### Making an HTTP Request to Get the Page Content
```python
    response = requests.get(phrase_url)
```
- **`requests.get(phrase_url)`**: This line sends a GET request to the constructed URL. It fetches the HTML content of the webpage corresponding to the phrase (e.g., the ASL video page for "hello").

#### Checking the Response Status
```python
    if response.status_code == 200:
```
- **`response.status_code == 200`**: This checks whether the request was successful. A status code of `200` means the page exists and was retrieved correctly.

#### Parsing the HTML Content
```python
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
```
- **`BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')`**: This parses the HTML content of the page into a BeautifulSoup object (`soup`), which allows us to easily search and navigate the page's elements.

#### Extracting the Video URL
```python
        video_tag = soup.find('video')
```
- **`soup.find('video')`**: This searches the parsed HTML for the first `<video>` tag. In the ASL website's page structure, the video is usually embedded in a `<video>` tag.

#### Finding the Video Source URL
```python
        if video_tag and video_tag.find('source'):
            video_url = video_tag.find('source')['src']
```
- **`video_tag.find('source')`**: If the `<video>` tag is found, this line searches for the `<source>` tag inside it, which contains the actual URL for the video.
- **`video_url = video_tag.find('source')['src']`**: This extracts the `src` attribute of the `<source>` tag, which contains the video URL.

#### Opening the Video URL in the Browser
```python
            print(f"Found video for '{phrase}': {video_url}")
            webbrowser.open(video_url)
```
- **`print(f"Found video for '{phrase}': {video_url}")`**: This outputs the found video URL to the console, showing the user which video was found.
- **`webbrowser.open(video_url)`**: This opens the video URL in the default web browser, allowing the user to watch the video.

#### Handling the Case Where No Video is Found
```python
        else:
            print(f"No video found for: {phrase}")
```
- **`else`**: If no `<video>` tag or no `<source>` tag is found, it prints that no video was found for the given phrase.

#### Handling Non-Existent Pages
```python
    else:
        print(f"Page not found for phrase: {phrase_url}")
```
- If the page corresponding to the phrase doesn't exist (i.e., if the status code is not 200), this prints a message saying the page could not be found.

#### Handling Request Errors
```python
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while searching: {e}")
```
- **`except requests.RequestException as e`**: This catches any errors that might occur during the HTTP request (e.g., network issues, invalid URL) and prints an error message.

### Main Function to Run the Program
```python
def main():
    print("ASL Phrase Video Finder")
    phrase = input("Enter a phrase to search for (e.g., hello, how are you): ").strip().lower()
    search_asl_phrase(phrase)
```
- **`main()`**: This is the main function that runs when the script is executed.
- **`input("Enter a phrase to search for (e.g., hello, how are you): ").strip().lower()`**: This prompts the user to enter a phrase. It removes extra spaces around the input and converts it to lowercase to ensure the input is handled consistently.
- **`search_asl_phrase(phrase)`**: This calls the `search_asl_phrase` function with the user input.

### Running the Script
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This condition ensures that the `main()` function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it is imported as a module).
- **`main()`**: Calls the `main()` function to start the program.

### Summary:
1. The program takes an input phrase (like "hello" or "how are you").
2. It constructs a URL by replacing spaces with hyphens and checks if the corresponding page exists on the ASL website.
3. If the page exists, it parses the page to find the video URL and opens it in the browser.
4. If no video is found, it prints a message saying so.
